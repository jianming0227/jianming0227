👋 Hi, I’m @jianming0227

👀 I’m interested in exploring the vast possibilities of spatial computing and extended reality (XR).

🌱 I’m currently enhancing my skills in 3D modeling, game development, cloud computing, and XR technology to stay ahead in this exciting field.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative XR projects that push the boundaries of what is possible.

📫 How to reach me: @jian._.mingg

⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about creating a future where extended reality is as ubiquitous as smartphones are today.

I am an XR enthusiast who finds spatial computing fascinating and fun to learn. The prospect of a future world where everyone can experience extended reality just like how we use our phones now is incredibly exciting. I am strengthening my skills in 3D modeling, game development, cloud computing, and XR to be well-prepared for these upcoming changes.
